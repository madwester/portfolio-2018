            <h1>Hello there,</h1>
                <p>
                I am a Sydney based budding Frontend developer. I am currently completing my Bachelor of IT as well as working on 
                some freelance projects. During my time studying I have touched all parts of programming, from backend to frontend, 
                databases and computer science. 
                I would now call myself a frontend enthusiast with a desire to learn and a passion for problem solving. 
                I am excited to turn my passion for programming into a career where I can continue
                to learn and grow. I am curious, eager to learn and love a challenge.
