            <h1>Hello there,</h1>
                <p>
                I'm Maddie, a budding frontend developer based in Sydney. I'm currently freelancing, whilst I complete my Bachelor of IT in 
                June of 2018.
                In my 2 years as a coder, I have touched all parts of programming from backend to frontend, databases and 
                computer science.
                I would now call myself a frontend enthusiast with a desire to learn and a passion for problem solving. I'm curious, eager 
                to learn and love a challenge!
                Turning this passion into a career where I can continue to learn and grow has for a long time been a dream and I can't wait to see where it takes me.
